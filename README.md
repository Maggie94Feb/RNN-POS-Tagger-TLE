# Part-of-speech tagging for Treebank of Learner English corpora with Recurrent Neural Networks

## Motivation

>Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging)

POS tagging could be the fundamentals of many NLP/NLU tasks, such as Name Entity Recognition (NER) and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). In this project, I want to explore the state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based models for POS tagging. The following are the candidate models:
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Bidirectional LSTM (BI-LSTM)
- LSTM with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer (LSTM-CRF) 
- Bidirectional LSTM with a CRF layer (BI-LSTM-CRF)

(**Update 2018/04/14: the BI-LSTM is added**)  
(**Update 2018/04/12: the basic LSTM is added**)  

## Dataset

>UD English-ESL/TLE is a collection of 5,124 English as a Second Language (ESL) sentences (97,681 words), manually annotated with POS tags and dependency trees in the Universal Dependencies formalism. Each sentence is annotated both in its original and error corrected forms. The annotations follow the standard English UD guidelines, along with a set of supplementary guidelines for ESL. The dataset represents upper-intermediate level adult English learners from 10 native language backgrounds, with over 500 sentences for each native language. The sentences were randomly drawn from the Cambridge Learner Corpus First Certificate in English (FCE) corpus. The treebank is split randomly to a training set of 4,124 sentences, development set of 500 sentences and a test set of 500 sentences. Further information is available at [esltreebank.org](esltreebank.org).

### Data Loader

I've built a data loader for this dataset. To use the data loader, you need to first install the [CoNLL-U Parser](https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/conllu) built by [Emil Stenstr√∂m](https://github.com/EmilStenstrom). The following is an example to use data_loader:


```python
import data_loader

meta_list, data_list = data_loader.load_data(load_train=True, load_dev=True, load_test=True)

train_meta, train_meta_corrected, \
dev_meta, dev_meta_corrected, \
test_meta, test_meta_corrected = meta_list

train_data, train_data_corrected, \
dev_data, dev_data_corrected, \
test_data, test_data_corrected = data_list
```

### Metadata
- doc_id: filename (also learner ID) of the original xml file
- sent: raw text of the sentence written by the leaner with error corrected tags
- native_language: native language of the leaner
- age_range: age range of the learner
- score: exam score of the learner

Some observations:
- "native_language" enables us to design tasks related to native language identificaiton.
- "age_range" enables us to identify the learner's age based on his/her writing style.
- "score" can help us to group learners into categories, such as Beginner, Intermediate, Expert, Fluent, Proficient. It enables us to discover the writing style and common mistakes of different groups of learners.


```python
train_meta.head()

## RNN Models

In this project, I mainly use [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) to implement the RNN models. The following are what I've already implemented:

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
>Long short-term memory (LSTM) units (or blocks) are a building unit for layers of a recurrent neural network (RNN). A RNN composed of LSTM units is often called an LSTM network. A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell is responsible for "remembering" values over arbitrary time intervals; hence the word "memory" in LSTM. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)

The following is the high-level architecture for the LSTM model:

![Task1_LSTM](figures/task1-w2v-lstm.png)

### Bidirectional LSTM (BI-LSTM)

The BI-LSTM model is derived from Bidrectional RNN (BRNN) (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997).

>The principle of BRNN is to split the neurons of a regular RNN into two directions, one for positive time direction (forward states), and another for negative time direction (backward states). Those two states‚Äô output are not connected to inputs of the opposite direction states. By using two time directions, input information from the past and future of the current time frame can be used unlike standard RNN which requires the delays for including future information. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks)

The BI-LSTM is based on BRNN but replaces the RNN units with LSTM units. The following is the high-level architecture for the BI-LSTM model:

![Task1_BILSTM](figures/task1-w2v-bi-lstm.png)


## Task 1: Continuous POS tagging with RNNs

### Architecture

In this task, a POS tagger was trained with all train data (4124 sentences), validated with dev data (500 sentences), and tested with test data (500 sentences). The following is the architecture:

![Task1 Architecture](figures/task1-arch.png)


### Word Features

I use the pre-trained [Word2Vec model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit) built with Google News corpus (3 million 300-dimension English word vectors). Although it might not be the best choice (e.g. Google News corpus might not be representative for the English Learner text), it's still a legitimate choice: 1) It saves my time to build a large dictionary which cover all words in the UD English-ESL/TLE corpus; 2) It saves my time and computing resources to build large/sparse unigram vectors for words, and I don't need to worry about dimension reduction for now; 3) 300-dim w2v vector is small enough for this task, and the dimension is fixed so the vector can be directly used in NN. 4) It's free and available on Google Drive :). 

### Experiments

#### Performance

The dataset was divided into train, dev, test sets. I used train and dev sets to observe the fluctuation of accuracy and loss during the training process of 1000 epochs. There are 17 different POS tags in this experiment. The prediction is considered as true postive only if it is the same as the actual POS tag. The optimizer of RNNs is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with different learning rate (lr). The loss function is Cross Entropy Loss.

The following is the best performance after 100 epochs:

- lr = 0.5

| Model | Train Accuracy | Dev Accuracy  | Test Accuracy |
| ------------- |:-------------|:-------------|:-------------:|
| LSTM  | 89.28% | 83.90% | 89.20% |
| BI-LSTM  | 93.25% | 88.00% | 93.30% |

- lr = 0.1

| Model | Train Accuracy | Dev Accuracy  | Test Accuracy |
| ------------- |:-------------|:-------------|:-------------:|
| LSTM  | 73.77% | 71.86% | 74.11% |
| BI-LSTM  | 78.37% | 76.17% | 78.54% |

The BI-LSTM model consistantly performs better than the LSTM model and achieve 93% in accuracy (lr=0.5). 

#### Parameter Tuning

The following are train/dev accuracy and loss in 100 epochs:

- lr = 0.5

![Task1_Accu_lr0.5](figures/lstm_lr-0.5_accu_comparison.png)
![Task1_Loss_lr0.5](figures/lstm_lr-0.5_loss_comparison.png)

- lr = 0.1

![Task1_Accu_lr0.1](figures/lstm_lr-0.1_accu_comparison.png)
![Task1_Loss_lr0.1](figures/lstm_lr-0.1_loss_comparison.png)


According to the above figures, both LSTM and BI-LSTM are not apparently overfitting. BI-LSTM learned faster and better than LSTM model.
